# fyp2023

Use the public dataset from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zr7vgbcyr2/1 . The data should go in the same level, as the code of this repository, and stay in the same organisation as when you download it. 

```
├── data
│   ├── images         <- Images
│   └── metadata.csv   <- Labels, demographic variables etc

├── fyp2023            <- Your project repository
